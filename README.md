# hello-world
Here's to the journey on coding!

I keep entertaining the idea of making a career change but always get overwhelmed or distracted. I need to commit and do some self studying!
That should help me find out if I am really interested in coding/developing.
It should also help me decide if I really want to go to coding school.
